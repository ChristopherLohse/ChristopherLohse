# Christopher Lohse 👋

Hey, I'm Chris, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin 🎓. My research focuses on applying **causal machine learning** methods to energy and latency optimisation problems ⚡⏱️. The goal is to use existing domain knowledge to build causal models of physical systems—like cloud infrastructure ☁️ or 5G networks 📶—to identify the drivers of high energy consumption and ultimately develop more explainable and sustainable allocation models 🌱🔍.
